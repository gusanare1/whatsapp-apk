1. Download the latest Appium (https://github.com/appium/appium-desktop/releases/latest)
I have used appium-desktop-Setup-1.5.0-ia32.exe. You can run the exe to install the appium desktop app

2. Download and Install Android Studio(https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)
Once you install Android Studio make sure the AVD Manager is also installed as we are going to run our tests on an emulator. Set ANDROID_HOME to be your Android SDK path and add the tools and platform-tools folders to your PATH variable. I could find the Android SDK installed on the below-mentioned path
$\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk

3. Install the Java JDK
Set JAVA_HOME to your JDK folder

4. Install the Python client library
There are client libraries (in Java, Ruby, Python, PHP, JavaScript, and C#) which support Appiumâ€™s extensions to the WebDriver protocol. When using Appium, you want to use these client libraries instead of your regular WebDriver client. I have used the Appium Python client available here. Assuming you have pip installed on your machine, you can use the following command to install it

python pip install Appium-Python-Client
